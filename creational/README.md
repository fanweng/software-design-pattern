# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns relate to how objects are constructed from classes. They would give out suggestions on how to encapsulate the object creation process in a program.

+ **Builder**
+ **Prototype**
+ **Singleton**
  + a class only has one instance, and provide a global access point
  + thread-safe instantiation
+ **Simple Factory**
  + let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate
+ Factory Method
  + let a class defer instantiation to subclasses
+ **Abstract Factory**
  + provide an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
